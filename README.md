# Painter/Decorator Estimation Tool - Desktop version

This is a simple Java application with an integrated algorithm to help painters and decorators quickly estimate the cost and
quanity of paint required for a particular job. I built this in the planning stages of Quick Paint.

# How does it work:

* Enter room dimensions in metres.
* Select the areas you want to paint and how many times.
* Choose the paint type you will be using.
* Given the above information, the application will produce a result of total paint cost(Â£) and the quantity required(Gallons/Litres)
